1.  Introduction

   SRv6 refers to Segment Routing instantiated on the IPv6 dataplane [I-
   D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming][I-D.ietf-6man-segment-rou
   ting-header].

   SRv6-based VPN (SRv6-VPN) refers to the creation of VPN between PE's
   leveraging the SRv6 dataplane and more specifically the END.DT*
   (crossconnect to a VRF) and END.DX* (crossconnect to a nexthop)
   functions defined in the SRv6 network programming document

Internet-Draft   BGP Signalling of IPv6-SR VPN Networks       March 2017


   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming].  SRv6-L3VPN refers to
   the creation of Layer3 VPN service between PE's supporting an SRv6
   data plane.

   SRv6 SID refers to a SRv6 Segment Identifier as defined in
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming].

   SRv6-VPN SID refers to an SRv6 SID that MAY be associated with one of
   the END.DT or END.DX functions as defined in
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming].

   To provide SRv6-VPN service with best-effort connectivity, the egress
   PE signals an SRv6-VPN SID with the VPN route.  The ingress PE
   encapsulates the VPN packet in an outer IPv6 header where the
   destination address is the SRv6-VPN SID provided by the egress PE.
   The underlay between the PE's only need to support plain IPv6
   forwarding [RFC2460].

   To provide SRv6-VPN service in conjunction with an underlay SLA from
   the ingress PE to the egress PE, the egress PE colors the VPN route
   with a color extended community.  The ingress PE encapsulates the VPN
   packet in an outer IPv6 header with an SRH that contains the SR
   policy associated with the related SLA followed by the SRv6-VPN SID
   associated with the route.  The underlay nodes whose SRv6 SID's are
   part of the SRH must support SRv6 data plane.

   BGP is used to advertise the reachability of prefixes in a particular
   VPN from an egress Provider Edge (egress-PE) to ingress Provider Edge
   (ingress-PE) nodes.

   This document describes how existing BGP messages between PEs may
   carry SRv6 Segment IDs (SIDs) as the means to interconnect PEs and
   form VPNs.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  BGP for SRv6-L3VPN

   BGP egress nodes (egress-PEs) advertise a set of reachable prefixes.
   Standard BGP update propagation schemes [RFC4271], which MAY make use
   of route reflectors [RFC4456], are used to propagate these prefixes.
   BGP ingress nodes (ingress-PE) receive these advertisements and may
   add the prefix to the RIB in an appropriate VRF.

Internet-Draft   BGP Signalling of IPv6-SR VPN Networks       March 2017


   For PEs supporting SRv6 the egress-PE advertises an SRv6-VPN SID with
   VPN routes.  This SRv6-VPN SID only has local significance at the
   egress-PE where it is allocated or configured on a per-CE or per-VRF
   basis.  In practice the SID encodes a cross-connect to a specific
   Address Family table (END.DT) or next-hop/interface (END.DX) as
   defined in the SRv6 Network Programming Document
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming]

   The SRv6 VPN SID MAY be routable within the AS of the egress-PE and
   serves the dual purpose of providing reachability between ingress-PE
   and egress-PE while also encoding the VPN identifier.

   For each NLRI, the egress-PE includes a new optional, transitive BGP
   SRv6-VPN SID Path TLV as part of the BGP Prefix-SID
   Attribute[I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-prefix-sid].  It contains a list of SIDs,
   for L3VPN only a single SRv6-VPN SID is necessary.  See Section 3.1
   below for details on the SRv6-VPN SID TLV.

   At an ingress-PE, BGP installs the advertised prefix in the correct
   RIB table, recursive via an SR Policy leveraging the received
   SRv6-VPN SID.

   Assuming best-effort connectivity to the egress PE, the SR policy has
   a single path with a single SID list made of a single SID: the
   SRv6-VPN SID received with the related route.

   When the VPN route is colored with an extended color community C and
   the SID is next-hop N and the ingress PE has a valid SRv6 Policy (N,
   C) associated with SID list <S1,S2, S3>
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-policy] then the SR Policy is
   <S1, S2, S3, SRv6-VPN SID>.

   Multiple VPN routes MAY recurse on the same SR Policy.

3.1.  SRv6-VPN SID TLV

   The SRv6-VPN SID TLV is defined as another TLV for BGP-Prefix-SID
   Attribute [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-prefix-sid].  The value field of the BGP
   Prefix SID attribute is defined here to be a set of elements encoded
   as "Type/Length/Value" (i.e., a set of TLVs).  Type for SRv6-VPN SID
   TLV is defined to be TBD.

   The IPv6-SID TLV MUST be present in the Prefix-SID attribute attached
   to MP-BGP VPN NLRI defined in [RFC4659][RFC5549][RFC7432] when
   egress-PE is capable of SRv6 data-plane.

   SRv6 SID information is encoded as follows:

                  +---------------------------------------+
                  |  SID Type (1 Octet)                   |

   Where:

   o  Type is TBD

   o  Length: 16bit field.  The total length of the value portion of the
      TLV.

   o  RESERVED: 8 bit field.  SHOULD be 0 on transmission and MUST be
      ignored on reception.

   Current Type of SID defined as:

   o  Type-1 - corresponds to the equivalent functionality provided by
      an VPN MPLS Label attribute when received with a route containing
      a MPLS label[RFC4364].

3.2.  IPv4 VPN Over SRv6 Core

   IPv4 VPN Over IPv6 Core is defined in [RFC5549], the MP_REACH_NLRI is
   encoded as follows for an SRv6 Core:

   o  AFI = 1

   o  SAFI = 128

   o  Length of Next Hop Network Address = 16 (or 32)

   o  Network Address of Next Hop = IPv6 address of the egress PE

   o  NLRI = IPv4-VPN routes

   o  Label = Implicit-Null

   SRv6-VPN SID are encoded as part of the SRv6-VPN SID TLV defined in
   Section 3.1.  The function of the SRv6 SID is entirely up to the
   originator of the advertisement.  In practice the function would
   likely be End.DX4 or End.DT4.

3.3.  IPv6 VPN Over SRv6 Core

   IPv6 VPN over IPv6 Core is defined in [RFC4659], the MP_REACH_NLRI is
   enclosed as follows for an SRv6 Core:

   o  AFI = 2

   o  SAFI = 128

   o  Length of Next Hop Network Address = 16 (or 32)

   o  Network Address of Next Hop = IPv6 address of the egress PE

   o  NLRI = IPv6-VPN routes

   o  Label = Implicit-Null

   SRv6-VPN SID are encoded as part of the SRv6-VPN SID TLV defined in
   Section 3.1.  The function of the IPv6 SRv6 SID is entirely up to the
   originator of the advertisement.  In practice the function would
   likely be End.DX6 or End.DT6.

4.  Migration from L3 MPLS based Segment Routing to SRv6 Segment Routing

   Migration from IPv4 MPLS based underlay to an SRv6 underlay with BGP
   speakers is achieved with BGP sessions per BGP instance, one for IPv4
   and a one for IPv6.  Migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is independent of
   SRv6 BGP endpoints, and the selection of which route to use (received
   via the IPv4 or IPv6 session) is a local configurable decision of the
   ingress-PE, and is outside the scope of this document.

   Migration from IPv6 MPLS based underlay to an SRv6 underlay with BGP
   speakers is achieved with a few simple rules at each BGP speaker.

Internet-Draft   BGP Signalling of IPv6-SR VPN Networks       March 2017


 At Egress-PE
   If BGP offers an SRv6-VPN service
       Then BGP allocates an SRv6-VPN SID for the VPN service
       and adds the BGP SRv6-VPN SID TLV while advertising VPN prefixes.
   If BGP offers an MPLS VPN service
       Then BGP allocates an MPLS Label for the VPN service and
       use it in NLRI as normal for MPLS L3 VPNs.

 At Ingress-PE
   *Selection of which encapsulation below (SRv6-VPN or MPLS-VPN) is
    defined by local BGP policy
   If BGP supports SRv6-VPN service, and
   receives a BGP SRv6-VPN SID Attribute with an SRv6 SID
       Then BGP programs the destination prefix in RIB recursive via
       the related SR Policy.
   If BGP supports MPLS VPN service, and
   the MPLS Label is not Implicit-Null
       Then the MPLS label is used as a VPN label and inserted with the
       prefix into RIB via the BGP Nexthop.


5.  EVPN and SRv6

   The EVPN SRv6 solution is actively under definition and will be added
   in a later revision.

6.  Error Handling of BGP SRv6 SID Updates

   When a BGP Speaker receives a BGP Update message containing a
   malformed SRv6-VPN SID TLV, it MUST ignore the received BGP
   attributes and not pass it to other BGP peers.  This is equivalent to
   the -attribute discard- action specified in [RFC7606].  When
   discarding an attribute, a BGP speaker MAY log an error for further
   analysis.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   already specified in [RFC4271] and [RFC3107].
