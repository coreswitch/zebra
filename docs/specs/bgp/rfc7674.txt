RFC 7674          Flowspec Redirect Extended Community      October 2015


1.  Introduction

   "Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules" [RFC5575], commonly known
   as BGP Flowspec, provided for a BGP Extended Community [RFC4360] that
   served to redirect traffic to a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)
   instance that matched the flow specification's Network Layer
   Reachability Information (NLRI).  In RFC 5575, the Redirect Extended
   Community was documented as follows:

   : +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
   : | type   | extended community | encoding                 |
   : +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
   : | 0x8008 | redirect           | 6-byte Route Target      |
   : +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
   :
   : [...]
   :
   : Redirect:  The redirect extended community allows the traffic to be
   : redirected to a VRF routing instance that lists the specified
   : route-target in its import policy.  If several local instances
   : match this criteria, the choice between them is a local matter
   : (for example, the instance with the lowest Route Distinguisher
   : value can be elected).  This extended community uses the same
   : encoding as the Route Target extended community [RFC4360].
   : [...]
   :
   : 11. IANA Considerations
   : [...]
   :
   : The following traffic filtering flow specification rules have been
   : allocated by IANA from the "BGP Extended Communities Type -
   : Experimental Use" registry as follows:
   : [...]
   :
   : 0x8008 - Flow spec redirect

   The IANA registry of BGP Extended Communities clearly identifies
   communities of specific formats.  For example, "Two-octet AS Specific
   Extended Community" [RFC4360], "Four-octet AS Specific Extended
   Community" [RFC5668], and "IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community"
   [RFC4360].  Route Targets [RFC4360] identify this format in the high-
   order (Type) octet of the Extended Community and set the value of the
   low-order (Sub-Type) octet to 0x02.  The Value field of the Route
   Target Extended Community is intended to be interpreted in the
   context of its format.

RFC 7674          Flowspec Redirect Extended Community      October 2015


   Since the Redirect Extended Community only registered a single
   codepoint in IANA's BGP Extended Community registry, a common
   interpretation of the Redirect Extended Community's "6-byte Route
   Target" has been to look, at a receiving router, for a Route Target
   value that matches the Route Target value in the received Redirect
   Extended Community and import the advertised route to the
   corresponding VRF instance subject to the rules defined in [RFC5575].
   However, because the Route Target format in the Redirect Extended
   Community is not clearly defined, the wrong match may occur.

   This "value wildcard" matching behavior, which does not take into
   account the format of the Route Target defined for a local VRF and
   may result in the wrong matching decision, does not match deployed
   implementations of BGP Flowspec.  Deployed implementations of BGP
   Flowspec solve this problem by defining different Redirect Extended
   Communities that are specific to the format of the Route Target
   value.  This document defines the following Redirect Extended
   Communities:

   +--------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+
   | type   | extended community | encoding                            |
   +--------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+
   | 0x8008 | redirect AS-2byte  | 2-octet AS, 4-octet Value           |
   | 0x8108 | redirect IPv4      | 4-octet IPv4 Address, 2-octet Value |
   | 0x8208 | redirect AS-4byte  | 4-octet AS, 2-octet Value           |
   +--------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+

   It should be noted that the low-order nibble of the Redirect's Type
   field corresponds to the Route Target Extended Community format field
   (Type).  (See Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 4 of [RFC4360] plus Section 2 of
   [RFC5668].)  The low-order octet (Sub-Type) of the Redirect Extended
   Community remains 0x08, in contrast to 0x02 for Route Targets.

   The IANA registries for the BGP Extended Communities document
   [RFC7153] was written to update the previously mentioned IANA
   registries to better document BGP Extended Community formats.  The
   IANA Considerations section below further amends those registry
   updates in order to properly document the Flowspec redirect
   communities.

2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  BGP Transitive Extended Community Types

   IANA has updated the "BGP Transitive Extended Community Types"
   registry as follows:

   0x81 -  Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended Community Part 2
           (Sub-Types are defined in the "Generic Transitive
           Experimental Extended Community Part 2 Sub-Types" Registry)

   0x82 -  Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended Community Part 3
           (Sub-Types are defined in the "Generic Transitive
           Experimental Use Extended Community Part 3 Sub-Types"
           Registry)

2.2.  Update to BGP Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended
      Community Sub-Types

   IANA has updated the "BGP Generic Transitive Experimental Use
   Extended Community Sub-Types" registry as follows:

     0x08 - Flow spec redirect AS-2byte format   [RFC5575] [RFC7674]

2.3.  Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended Community Part 2
      Sub-Types

   IANA has created the "Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended
   Community Part 2 Sub-Types" registry.  This has been created under
   the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Extended Communities" registry and
   contains the following note:

      This registry contains values of the second octet (the "Sub-Type"
      field) of an extended community when the value of the first octet
      (the "Type" field) is 0x81.

   Registry Name: Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended Community
   Part 2 Sub-Types

     RANGE              REGISTRATION PROCEDURE
     0x00-0xbf          First Come First Served
     0xc0-0xff          IETF Review

     SUB-TYPE VALUE     NAME                             REFERENCE
     0x00-0x07          Unassigned
     0x08               Flow spec redirect IPv4 format   [RFC7674]
     0x09-0xff          Unassigned

2.4.  Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended Community Part 3
      Sub-Types

   IANA has created the "Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended
   Community Part 3 Sub-Types" registry.  This registry has been created
   under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Extended Communities"
   registry and contains the following note:

      This registry contains values of the second octet (the "Sub-Type"
      field) of an extended community when the value of the first octet
      (the "Type" field) is 0x82.

   Registry Name: Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended Community
   Part 2 Sub-Types

     RANGE              REGISTRATION PROCEDURE
     0x00-0xbf          First Come First Served
     0xc0-0xff          IETF Review

     SUB-TYPE VALUE     NAME                                 REFERENCE
     0x00-0x07          Unassigned
     0x08               Flow spec redirect AS-4byte format   [RFC7674]
     0x09-0xff          Unassigned

3.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no additional security considerations than
   those already covered in [RFC5575].  It should be noted that if the
   wildcard behavior were actually implemented, this ambiguity may lead
   to the installation of Flowspec rules in an incorrect VRF and may
   lead to traffic to be incorrectly delivered.
